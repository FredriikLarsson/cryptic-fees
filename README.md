# The project "CrypticFees"

This project was created to meet the everyday user with limited knowledge about cryptocurrencies and blockchains so that they very easily could see what it would cost them to transfer cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. It doesnt exist a service today that users with limited knowledge can find in a simple way what a transaction at this exact moment will cost them. It is also a question in some cases how fast a user want the transaction to be, which will affect the cost of the transaction. This web application will not only provide that information, it will do so in a very user friendly way aswell as educate the users somewhat in important areas about transaction feeÂ´s on blockchains. 

## Run development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
